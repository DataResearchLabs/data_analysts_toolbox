## Overview
* **What**: A free, simple utility for generating data dictionaries as CSV, Excel, or PDF files.  Bonus: generates comment scripts and data dictionary scripts for you to modify and run as needed.<br>
* **Levelset**: A "Data Dictionary" is simply a list of tables and views, their column properties such as name, ordinal position, data type/length/size/precision, allows nulls, and of course the column description. A good data dictionary also indicates which columns are a part of a primary key, foreign key, or unique key.<br>
* **Why**: Data dictionaries can be used to train new employees how your system is setup. They can be used as a baseline for new projects, an "as-built" set of documentation from which to start. They can be used as close-out documentation to wrap-up a project and push it out into Excel on a wiki or Sharepoint, etc.<br>
* **How**: Download and run .accde file.  From there, click open and follow the Wizard steps to run the job against a SQL Server database of your choic.  The appropriate output you selected will popup in Notepad, or Excel, or Acrobat Reader.<br>
* **Who**: Built as a standalone tool for individual data analysts, systems analysts, ,software test engineers, or similar folks.<br>
* **Where**: On a desktop or laptop.  **Requires Microsoft Access 365**.  Yep, it is a VBA application, [read here for why](https://github.com/DataResearchLabs/my_task_time_tracker/blob/main/src/SOURCE_CODE.md#whyMicrosoftAccess)<br>
* **License**: Creative Commons Zero, effectively public domain.  Free to use.  Free to copy.  Free to alter.  Free to distribute.<br>
