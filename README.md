Collection of useful data analyst tools to manipulate everything from text files to database systems like MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or Postgresql.<br><br>

This Data Dictionary Generator tool is easier and faster to use than [scripts](https://github.com/DataResearchLabs/sql_scripts/blob/main/data_dictionary_scripts.md) to easily document an existing database schema.  You can dump the tables, views, colun descriptions, data types/lengths/sizes/precision, key constraints, and othr information.  Results can be instantly exported to CSV, Excel, or even PDF.  You can generate just the comments script for tables and columns for you to edit and run, then put under source control.  You can outupt the SQL script used to generate the data dictionary for you own use embedding into your systems and tools.<br>

This End-of-Line Editor tool enables you to easily view and/or change the end-of-line characters (EOL-chars) in a target text file.<br>
Often, Data Analyst need to determine why a text file is erroring on load and can quickly spot that it has say Linux end-of-line characters (LF) where PC is expected (CRLF).   Data analysts can also use this tool to quickly find that elusive one row that is ending with linefeed (LF) where all other rows end with PC EOL (CRLF).  Software and User Acceptance Testers can use this tool to quickly generate different file formats (PC, Linux/Unix/MacOSX, and Mac-Classic).<br>
