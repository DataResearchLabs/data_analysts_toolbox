# Data Analysts' Toolbox - Prototypes

## Overview
Collection of useful data analyst tools to manipulate everything from text files to database systems like MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or Postgresql. 

Although these prototypes are written in Microsoft Access, don't be fooled.  Access is used simply for its strenghs: rapid user interface prototyping, simple report prototyping, and more easily deployed in a corporate environment than an .exe file.  Any database work avoids its weakness (file based data storage) by running SQL directly thru to server.

The plan is to re-write prototypes that are heavily downloaded and used in c# and/or python at some point in the future, time permitting.
