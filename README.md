This End-of-Line Editor tool enables you to easily view and/or change the end-of-line characters (EOL-chars) in a target text file.<br>
Often, Data Analyst need to determine why a text file is erroring on load and can quickly spot that it has say Linux end-of-line characters (LF) where PC is expected (CRLF).   Data analysts can also use this tool to quickly find that elusive one row that is ending with linefeed (LF) where all other rows end with PC EOL (CRLF).  Software and User Acceptance Testers can use this tool to quickly generate different file formats (PC, Linux/Unix/MacOSX, and Mac-Classic).<br>
