# Data Analysts' Toolbox - Prototypes

## Overview
Collection of useful data analyst tools to manipulate everything from text files to database systems like MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or Postgresql. 

Disclaimer:  These tools are all prototyped in [Microsoft Access](https://github.com/DataResearchLabs/data_analysts_toolbox_prototypes/blob/main/FAQ.md#q01)


## Text Files


### [End-of-Line Editor](https://github.com/DataResearchLabs/data_analysts_toolbox_prototypes/blob/main/text_files_end_of_line_editor/ms_access.md)
The End-of-Line Editor tool enables you to easily view and/or change the end-of-line character(s) in a target text file.<br>
Data analysts trying to figure out why a text file is erroring can quickly spot that either the entire file has Linux end-of-line characters (LF) where PC is expected (CRLF).   Data analysts can also find that elusive one row that is ending with linefeed (LF) where all other rows end with PC EOL (CRLF).  Software and User Acceptance Testers can use this tool to quickly generate different file formats (PC, Linus/Unix, and old Mac).<br>
