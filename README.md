# Data Analysts' Toolbox - Prototypes

## Overview
Collection of useful data analyst tools to manipulate everything from text files to database systems like MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or Postgresql. 
These tools are all prototyped in Microsoft Access -- I know, groan...but MS-Access is a surprisingly excellent rapid development tool for quickly prototyping user interfaces, simple reports, table designs, and more.  

The significant downsides of Access are avoided: 
(a) don't use it for data storage except for tiny temp tables...use the big DBMS platforms like MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and Postgresql, and 
(b) be careful implenting security: never store passwords, run as ACCDE to prevent source code access/tampering.

The plan is to re-write those prototypes that get widely used into either c#, python, or both...time permitting, a year or two down the line.
