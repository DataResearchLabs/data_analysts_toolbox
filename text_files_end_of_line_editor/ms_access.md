#### Data Analysts' Toolbox

## Overview
* **What**: A free, lean task and time tracker with a simple user interface and several reports for analysis.<br>
* **When**: Use it daily.  Use it consistently.  It literally takes just 3 to 4 minutes per day.<br>
* **Who**: Built as a standalone tool for individual contributors working from a desktop or laptop computer.<br>
* **Why**: Rollup your time for better estimates, for better performance review discussions, to help optimize where effort gets focused, or just to set expectations for how long a complex thought-work-task takes.<br>
* **How**: Simple, low-tech, minimalist data entry that rolls up your time and tasks into meaningful, actionable reports.<br>
* **Where**: On a desktop or laptop.  **Requires Microsoft Access 365**.  Yep, it is a VBA application, [read here for why](https://github.com/DataResearchLabs/my_task_time_tracker/blob/main/src/SOURCE_CODE.md#whyMicrosoftAccess)
* **Source Code**: is open-source. Either (a) close all forms and press F11, **OR** (b) hold down the Shift-key when you open the application to access ALL source code.
* **License**: Creative Commons Zero, effectively public domain.  Free to use.  Free to copy.  Free to alter.  Free to distribute.<br>
